Sailing the FPL Seas: Treasure Hunters and Scurvy Dogs of the League



Bummer: Dangerous F.C.

Ah, the competition is fierce, but someone has to bring up the rear. This week, "Dangerous F.C.," managed by Geraint Davies, finds itself in that unenviable position. With 10 matches played, the team has garnered a total of 9 points, tying with last week's Bummer, "DHEEZ nuts," but falling short in other metrics. For this stellar underachievement, Geraint has been promoted to "Captain Bummer." You've got some climbing to do, Captain!

Teams at Risk: DHEEZ nuts and TrippierShroomsPlz
Watch out, James Kirk of "DHEEZ nuts" and Rhys Farnworth of "TrippierShroomsPlz." Both of you are dangerously close to the Bummer zone. James, your team also has 9 points but slightly better performance metrics, while Rhys, your team sits at 12 points. Keep your eyes on the ball; nobody wants to be the next Bummer.



Ranking Movers and Shakers
The tables have turned, and the standings have shuffled. Let's look at the teams that either climbed the ladder or slid down a notch.


Moved Up:

De bruyne ultimatum: Managed by Reagan Warburton, this team moved up one spot in the rankings. With a total of 15 points, they are showing signs of a comeback.
DHEEZ nuts: Despite being in the Bummer zone last week, James Kirk managed to move his team up by one rank, now sitting at the 7th position.


Moved Down:

Ajax Trees Down: Managed by Nikolai Izak, the team dropped one place but still holds a respectable 15 points.
Dangerous F.C.: Geraint Davies' team slid further down the table, moving from 7th to 8th place, accentuating their promotion to "Captain Bummer."



Last Week's Showdown: Drama, Dazzle, and Upsets

What a week it was—a veritable buffet of drama, thrill, and jaw-dropping moments! Here's the lowdown:


Ajax Trees Down vs. Lads on Toure: The turf was hostile for "Ajax Trees Down," who not only battled "Lads on Toure" but also their own spate of injuries. The 58-41 scoreboard tells the tale, as the visiting squad had a walk in the park.

De bruyne ultimatum vs. Dangerous F.C.: Ah, "Dangerous F.C.," the underachievers of the week, etching a season-low of 17 points. "De bruyne ultimatum" could've played with their eyes closed and still walked away with a 54-17 victory.

TrippierShroomsPlz vs. DHEEZ nuts: Last week's Bummer, "DHEEZ nuts," turned in a respectable 40 points—commendable but not enough. "TrippierShroomsPlz" was the showstopper, racking up a whopping 68 points to make their opponent look like a mere opening act.

warnehub vs. Flying Without Ings: The league's poster child for success, "warnehub," met their Waterloo. "Flying Without Ings" brought them back to Earth with a thud, notching a 51-31 victory that no one saw coming.

The curtain has drawn on another week, leaving us with memorable performances and cautionary tales. As the wheel of fortune turns, who will rise, and who will fall? Only time will tell.



Top Performers: The Sultans of Stats

In a game where every point is a step towards glory, these Premier League stars didn't just show up—they dominated:


Eddie Nketiah: The crown jewel of "Flying Without Ings," Nketiah dazzled with 17 event points this week. With a season total of 47 points, he's more than just a flash in the pan.

Erling Haaland: A titan in "TrippierShroomsPlz," Haaland was almost unstoppable, accumulating 16 event points. His staggering season total of 79 points is a testament to his relentless form.

Ethan Pinnock: A jaw-dropping blunder for "Flying Without Ings," who left Pinnock languishing on the bench while he racked up a staggering 15 event points. While his season total of 39 points may not be sky-high, his recent performance suggests he's one to watch.

These aren't just players; they're season-long phenomena, proving their mettle week in, week out. Hats off to these stat-sheet stuffers!

With some big games coming up at the weekend? Will we see a new leader or a new bummer?
