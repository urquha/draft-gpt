Ramsay's Ruthless Review: Fantasy Football’s Kitchen Nightmares

"Listen up, you donkeys! It's time to turn up the heat. 'Dangerous F.C.,' what are you? An 'Idiot Sandwich!' Winning a match but still at the bottom? That's like serving a burnt steak and expecting a Michelin star. Geraint, you've earned the rank of 'Major Bummer,' and trust me, that's one title you wouldn't want on your restaurant's sign. It's a kitchen nightmare, and you're the head chef!

And the rest of you lot, don't start grinning like you're off the hook. 'DHEEZ nuts' and 'TrippierShroomsPlz,' you're teetering on the edge like a soufflé ready to collapse. Pull it together or prepare to be the next laughing stock. As for 'warnehub,' you've been cooking on gas, but remember, every top chef has a bad day – don't let it be next week.

This league is about as forgiving as I am when someone overcooks the scallops – not at all. Get your lineups sorted out, or you'll find your team tossed in the bin like a rotten scallop. Wake up! Or you’ll find your chances of winning this league are as done as a well-done bloody steak!"
