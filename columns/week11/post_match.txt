FPL Weekly: Tactics, Triumphs, and Tribulations


Major Bummer in the Spotlight: Dangerous F.C. - Holding the Line with Honor

Winning the match but still rooted to the spot as 'Major Bummer,' Geraint Davies of 'Dangerous F.C.' is living proof that in this league, one win doesn't buy you grace.

The win? A mere consolation prize, as the shadow of the 'Bummer' looms large. Next week, he'll need more than a fluke to shake off the league's most infamous moniker.
