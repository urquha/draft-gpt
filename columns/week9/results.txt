The FPL Chronicles: The Good, the Bad, and the Ones to Watch


Bummer: DHEEZ nuts
Ah, the sweet scent of competition and the not-so-sweet aroma of defeat. Let's give a slow clap for this week's bottom-dweller, "DHEEZ nuts," managed by James Kirk. Despite nine matches played, the team has amassed a mere 9 points. For this consistent performance, Kirk has been promoted to "Second Lieutenant Bummer." Better luck next time, Second Lieutenant!
